Hello World intro to GitHub

Hi All,

I'm in my 4th semester at NWTC.  This is my second time going through college.  I have an international business degree from St. Norbert College.  In my spare time (ha!) I ballroom dance competitively in the very near area (usually 1 or 2 events within Wisconsin).
